  Hi, my name's Ryan and I'm an engineering lead. As well as development, my talents spread across <a href="https://logz.io/blog/what-devops-is-not/">DevOps</a>, agile coaching and delivery leadership.

  At the core of everything I work for, I believe there is no greater success than getting valuable features out to customers.

  I love to learn and sharpen my skills, and I am happy to work with most technologies or frameworks as long as they enable good delivery culture. I don't believe in skill silos and work tirelessly to ensure a cross-functional attitude is a core principle of the teams I work with.

          Providing engineering leadership and guidance across critical business initiatives
        description: |
          I currently work across multiple teams both within my tribe and teams who utilise the capabilities my tribe provides. My main focus are on strategic initiatives and delivery accelerants for the following areas;

          - A digital service platform consisting of Kubernetes with an Istio service mesh residing on AWS, which also includes a plethora of CNCF and OpenSource tooling designed to provide solutions to challenges within the DevOps lifecycle.
          - Microservice Architectures,including defining engineering good practice and solution architecture with teams.
          - Enablement team ownership, where I have established a working practice orientated around collaboration with teams with technical challenges within the organisation. We work closely with teams to understand their challenges and curate the solutions into a centralised space for improved organisational knowledge transfer.

          Engineering leadership and guidance with a focus on security
        description: |
          My main point of focus was design and development of shared services used across the breadth of the EU technology estate. These services had a focus on centralising corporate policies into a larger SOA estate. In order to accomplish this, I worked across the organisation holistically, integrating with a wide arena of stakeholders. I was aided by three teams, of which reported to me and I communicated technical strategy and vision, and facilitated the collaboration to execute it. These shared services include the maintenance and enhancement of shared libraries which are managed in an open source fashion, with myself as a steward of the technology.
          As part of this work, I endeavoured to pave the way for other delivery teams by establishing common design patterns, agile best practices and proving new technologies. Examples include the establishment of a logging framework which offers flexibility for consumption with an enterprise SIEM/ELK stack, authentication principles based on industry best practice (OAuth2) and utilisation of the Netflix OSS stack to solve application resiliency and support issues.

          Agile coaching and shaping development
        description: |
          Working on commercial finance software for offering credit loans to customers of high-profile retailers. I held a focus in technical leadership, coaching agility, development and security. The tech ecosystem was a Java system, including Hibernate, Struts 2, JSP, Spring Boot and Angular. I have also been a strong evangelist for the improvement of code quality, service decomposition, servant leadership, paired programming and improved testing techniques (inc. TDD & BDD). I have also done a substantial amount of work the the Business Analyst team around story refinement and story pointing.
          Starting at the organisation I was appointed with a tactical project addressing security issues, where shortly after a team was formed. I fast assumed a leadership role in the team, and also absorbed the Scrum Master role. After completion of the security project, the team was moved onto supporting the retail business stakeholders, where I have been a driving force for decomposing the monolithic legacy application into well engineered micro services, utilising Spring Boot & Cloud, Golang, Angular 2 frontends, containerisation, and test automation using BDD and Cucumber.

          From graduate to technical lead
        description: |
          My first project was working on the development of an armoured fighting vehicle mission system. Development was in C++ following safety critical deadlines. My greatest accomplishment on this project was a proof of concept which saved the organisation approximately Â£700k. I also contributed to a large piece of work involving military real-time video standards.
          Development of multi-touch executive dashboards for the energy market and military operations. This was initially in Visual Basic, but migrated to C# and utilising Bing Maps integration with PostGIS (geospatial extension for Postgres).
          I was given the opportunity to lead an R&D project which looked at the 3D Visualisation of CAD models as a mechanism for fast prototyping, increasing the speed of customer feedback loops. After scoping the system architecture and working through the procurement process, I developed complex interactive demonstrations for senior
          Lockheed Martin and MoD stakeholders, largely in Lua with some Java backend services. After a year of managing this R&D effort I was awarded Lockheed Martin's coveted national award for innovation, presented to me by the CEO.
          Leading a small team in real-time platform-level wargaming simulation and development. The largest technical challenges in this role were around the selection and integration of third party software to make a fully functioning system for military operation wargaming simulations. Interfaces included open and military standards. As an agility evangelist I was able to implement a Scrum methodology for the delivery of the software and hardware systems and their integrations, proving that Scrum is applicable to a larger audience than purely software development. My main duties included architecture, development, project management and stakeholder management & engagement (inc. the CEO).
